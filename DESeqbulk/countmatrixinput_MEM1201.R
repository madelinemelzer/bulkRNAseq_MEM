#'The purpose of this calculation is to assess the strand specificity of your RNA-seq library preparation method:
#'- In unstranded RNA-seq, reads align to both strands approximately equally. 
#'- In stranded RNA-seq, reads should align predominantly to either the forward or reverse strand, depending on the library preparation method.
#'
#'The propF and propR calculations give you the proportion of reads aligning to the forward and reverse strands, respectively, compared to the unstranded count.
#'Interpreting the results:
#'- For unstranded data, you'd expect propF and propR to be close to 0.5 each.
#'- For forward-stranded data, propF should be close to 1 and propR close to 0.
#'- For reverse-stranded data, propF should be close to 0 and propR close to 1.
